Define a function, shut_down, that takes one argument. Then, if the shut_down function receives "yes", it should return "Shutting down"
Alternatively, if it receives "no", then the function should return "Shutdown aborted".
Finally, if shut_down gets anything other than those inputs, the function should return "Sorry"


def shurt_down(arg):
    if arg == 'yes':
        retuen "Shuting down"
    elsif arg == 'no':
        return "Shutdown aborted"
    else:
        return "Sorry"

shurt_down("yes")
